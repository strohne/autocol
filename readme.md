# Workshop Data Collection

This repository contains exercise materials for the workshop. Before the workshop, please first download the repository by clicking Code -> Download ZIP. And please install the following software:

*Basics*  
- The browser Firefox and/or Chrome
- Facepager: https://github.com/strohne/Facepager
- A text editor with syntax highlighting, for example Notepad++, Atom or Textmate

*Python*  
- Option 1: Download Python directly from the webpage: https://www.python.org/downloads/ 
- Option 2: Download a distribution like Anaconda, which includes Python: https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual. 

*Libraries*  
During the workshop we will work with different Python libraries. Libraries are collections of functions, provided by other developers. 
To install the libraries, you can use pip - the installation manager that comes with Python. 
Therefore, you need to open your Commad Prompt (search for "cmd" on your desktop) and type in the following comands: 

```
pip install jupyterlab 
pip install os 
pip install requests 
pip install beautifulsoup4
pip install lxml
pip install pandas
```

(In case you haven't used pip before, it might be necessary, that you first add pip to the path variables of your computer. Navigate to the file on your computer where pip.exe is located and copy the path (e.g. C:\Users\Chantal\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python310\Scripts). Then go to your Environment Variables my navigating to them via Control Panel -> System and Security -> Sytem -> Advanced System Settings -> Environment Variables. Click on the "Path" variable and then click on "Edit" -> "New" and paste your directory path.) 
         
*Accounts* 
To follow the exercises you need accounts on the following platforms:
- Facebook

In case you struggle with intalling the Software or Libraries, don't hesitate to contact us! We are looking forward to the workshop and collecting data with you using the programs :)
